## üéØ How to Play

1. **Run the Game:** Execute `Game.py` using Python 3.
   ```bash
   python3 Game.py
   ```
2. **Gameplay:**

   - Red pieces represent the player.
   - Yellow pieces represent the AI.
   - Click on a column to place a piece.

3. **Winning Conditions:**
   - Four connected pieces horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
   - The game announces the winner or a draw if the board is full.

## üß† AI Logic Overview

- **Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning:**
  - Evaluates potential moves up to a given depth.
  - Uses a heuristic scoring function to evaluate board states.
  - Prunes branches of the search tree that won't affect the final decision.

- **Heuristic Evaluation:**
  - Scores board positions based on potential winning combinations.
  - Prefers center columns and longer chains of connected pieces.

- **Difficulty Adjustment:**
  - Search depth can be configured in the game settings.
